To run the project,

Your system have pre0installed python3.
Your system must have the following packages installed:
   
* numpy
* pandas
* KMeans
* confusion_matrix
* Munkres

Now, unzip the folder and open terminal/command prompt in that folder itself.
Fire the command: python project3.py
And the programm will generate the expected output.

There is a sample training data file which is used to train and test the model and calculate the accuracy.

I've printed the confusion metrix before re-ordering it and confusion metrix after re-ordering it, to identify the difference.

I've also printed accuracy to observe in change of accuracy due to re-ordering.
